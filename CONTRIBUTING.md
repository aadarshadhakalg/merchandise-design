## Code of Conduct 👮

Help us keep Merchandise Design open and inclusive. Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/MercandiseDesign/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Submit a Pull Request 🚀

Branch naming convention is as following:

YOUR-USER-NAME

Example:
kucc2005

**All PRs must include a commit message with the title of the sticker and a brief description of its motivation!**

For the initial start, fork the project and use git clone command to download the repository to your computer. A standard procedure for working on an issue would be to:

1. git pull: Before creating a new branch, pull the changes from upstream. Your master needs to be up to date.

   ```
   $ git pull
   ```

2. Create a new branch from master:

   ```
   $ git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]
   ```

3. Work - commit - repeat (make sure you're on the correct branch!)

4. Push changes to GitHub.

   ```
   $ git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]
   ```

5. Submit your changes for review: If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a Compare & pull request button. Click on that button.

6. Start a Pull Request: Now submit the pull request and click on Create pull request.

7. After approval, merge your PR.

8. GitHub will automatically delete the branch after the merge is done (they can still be restored).
